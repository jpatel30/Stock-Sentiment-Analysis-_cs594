These statements are based on our estimates and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements include the information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations. Forward-looking statements also include those preceded or followed by the words “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “hopes” or similar expressions. For those statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The following important factors, along with those discussed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), could affect future results and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements: adverse conditions in the U.S. and international economies; the effects of competition in the markets in which we operate; material changes in technology or technology substitution; disruption of our key suppliers’ provisioning of products or services; changes in the regulatory environment in which we operate, including any increase in restrictions on our ability to operate our networks; breaches of network or information technology security, natural disasters, terrorist attacks or acts of war or significant litigation and any resulting financial impact not covered by insurance; our high level of indebtedness; an adverse change in the ratings afforded our debt securities by nationally accredited ratings organizations or adverse conditions in the credit markets affecting the cost, including interest rates, and/or availability of further financing; material adverse changes in labor matters, including labor negotiations, and any resulting financial and/or operational impact; significant increases in benefit plan costs or lower investment returns on plan assets; changes in tax laws or treaties, or in their interpretation; changes in accounting assumptions that regulatory agencies, including the SEC, may require or that result from changes in the accounting rules or their application, which could result in an impact on earnings; and the inability to implement our business strategies.\r\n"}},{"id":37024404,"body":"Stocks with daily BEARISH ENGULFING PATTERN $AMG $AXP $CA $CRM $DAL $VZ $STX $MCHP $MDW $USB\nhttp://stks.co/p254m","created_at":"2015-05-18T12:44:34Z","user":{"id":509098,"username":"Quotatium","name":"QUOTATIUM","avatar_url":"http://avatars.stocktwits.com/production/509098/thumb-1430504984.png","avatar_url_ssl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/st-avatars/production/509098/thumb-1430504984.png","official":false,"identity":"User","classification":[],"join_date":"2015-04-28","followers":14,"following":69,"ideas":21,"following_stocks":6,"location":"","bio":"Quotatium is here to fill the gap in wall decor, prints, and gifts for the financial community.","website_url":"http://quotatium.com","trading_strategy":{"assets_frequently_traded":["Equities","Options","Forex","Futures","Bonds"],"approach":"Technical","holding_period":"Swing Trader","experience":"Professional"}},"source":{"id":1,"title":"StockTwits","url":"http://stocktwits.com"},"symbols":[{"id":346,"symbol":"MDW","title":"Midway Gold Corp."},{"id":1166,"symbol":"CA","title":"CA Technologies"},{"id":2609,"symbol":"MCHP","title":"Microchip Technology Inc."},{"id":3692,"symbol":"STX","title":"Seagate Technology PLC"},{"id":4333,"symbol":"AMG","title":"Affiliated Managers Group Inc."},{"id":4423,"symbol":"AXP","title":"American Express Company"},{"id":4828,"symbol":"CRM","title":"Salesforce.com"},{"id":4904,"symbol":"DAL","title":"Delta Air Lines Inc."},{"id":7584,"symbol":"USB","title":"U.S. Bancorp"},{"id":7696,"symbol":"VZ","title":"Verizon Communications Inc."}],"links":[{"title":"JAPANESE CANDLESTICKS","url":"http://quotatium.com/products/japanese-candlesticks","shortened_url":"http://stks.co/p254m","shortened_expanded_url":"quotatium.com/products/japa...","description":"Candlestick charts are a visual aid for decision making in stock, foreign exchange, commodity, and option trading.18\" x 24\" Print","image":"http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0746/2561/products/JAPANESE_PRODUCTO_grande.jpg?v=1429105514","created_at":"2015-05-18T12:44:40Z","video_url":null,"source":{"name":"QUOTATIUM","website":"http://quotatium.com"}}],"entities":{"chart":{"thumb":"http://charts.stocktwits.com/production/small_37024404.png","large":"http://charts.stocktwits.com/production/large_37024404.png","original":"http://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original_37024404.jpg","url":"http://stks.co/q25Ch"}}},{"id":37022138,"body":"12 High Quality Dividend Stocks for Retirement http://stks.co/r24wM $GIS $K $KMB $KO $MCD $MO $PG $SO $SYY $T $VZ $XOM","created_at":"2015-05-18T11:20:42Z","user":{"id":365413,"username":"SmarterAnalyst","name":"Smarter Analyst","avatar_url":"http://avatars.stocktwits.com/production/365413/thumb-1403016547.png","avatar_url_ssl":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/st-avatars/production/365413/thumb-1403016547.png","official":false,"identity":"User","classification":[],"join_date":"2014-06-17","followers":3087,"following":0,"ideas":4768,"following_stocks":0,"location":"","bio":"Smarter Analyst was established to fill a gap in financial reporting for sell-side investors, where they can read exclusive reports in real time.

At the time the tender offer is commenced, Verizon and its acquisition subsidiary will file tender offer materials on Schedule TO, and AOL will file a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with the SEC with respect to the tender offer. The tender offer materials (including an Offer to Purchase, a related Letter of Transmittal and certain other tender offer documents) and the Solicitation/Recommendation Statement will contain important information. Holders of shares of AOL are urged to read these documents when they become available because they will contain important information that holders of AOL securities should consider before making any decision regarding tendering their securities.
